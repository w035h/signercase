# Print Files

This is the first release of the STL and 3MF print Files.

You might meed to play around with the printer settings to get the pins and camera hold down to come out right.

If you want to make some modifications you can download the [FreeCAD](http://freecad.org) file and make it your own. Please consider to share your changes.

Have Fun!
