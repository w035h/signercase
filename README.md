# Hi There ðŸ‘‹
This is my version of a SeedSigner case. The camera is set to the side in order to make a lower profile possible.

Check out some more [images](/images/). 
To print it yourself check the [printfiles](/printfiles). 
There is also an [assembly guide](./Assembly.md).

The design was made using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org). If you are interested in making some changes or remixing it completely check out the FreeCAD file in the [CAD](/CAD/) folder].
